Finished the sign-up form but obviously there are things that I wasn't able to implement like the border focus for input fields. Background color works with input:focus but border color won't. I will definitely go back to this project just like those first ones. 

Yes, I still don't know what I'm doing. Not sure if I'm using the right property for each classes but I've been able to create a form using the knowledge that I have absorbed for weeks.

I will go back to this project. Thank you.
